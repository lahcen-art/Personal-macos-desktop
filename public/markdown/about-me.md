# About Me

## Biography

Hi, Iâ€™m Lahcen Azroual â€” a full-stack developer with a unique background in English literature and a deep passion for building intuitive, user-centered web applications. I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and thrive in fast-paced environments where creativity meets functionality.

What sets me apart is my ability to code by vibe â€” translating ideas into interactive interfaces with instinct and flow. My literature background sharpened my communication, analysis, and attention to detail â€” skills I now use to craft thoughtful user experiences and readable, scalable code.

Iâ€™m also exploring AI integration in web apps using APIs for language, vision, and personalization â€” and Iâ€™m committed to learning through real-world projects that make a meaningful impact, especially in Moroccoâ€™s digital future.

Currently, Iâ€™m focused on:

ðŸŽ¯ Building full-stack projects with the MERN stack

ðŸŽ¯ Developing fast front ends with React, Vite, and Zustand

ðŸŽ¯ Integrating AI APIs for enhanced functionality

ðŸŽ¯ Practicing vibe coding â€” fast, creative, and user-intuitive development

ðŸŽ¯ Leveling up through real-world projects, challenges, and curiosity

Rooted in language, empowered by logic, and driven by creativity, Iâ€™m passionate about building tools that are both intelligent and meaningful â€” especially with an eye on Moroccoâ€™s digital future.

Letâ€™s build something that feels as good as it works.
